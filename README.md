# [Uncompress](http://xndc.github.io/uncompress/)

This is a JavaScript implementation of [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)'s [`Uncompress[]`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Uncompress.html) function.

It can decompress the opaque blobs of text [`Compress[]`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Compress.html) produces and extract the expressions inside them. If you have a copy of Mathematica, go ahead and try it out! Bonus points if you break it and file a bug report.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
